# SIMPLY LOVE (Oat's Fork + Rya's Edit)

![logo time](https://i.jecket.xyz/ma2d0.png "log√∂")

Rya (that's me, Jecket) stole Oat's theme to add a bit of sweet salt to it, for personal use mostly

## Additional Features

Most features are already in https://github.com/oatmealine/simply-love-oat-fork so please check that out before you get confused

- Transparent default judgement (they're too big to get me distracted)
- More annoyances (you'll be greeted with random messages upon selecting quickplay)
- Restart game button because I can't be bothered to go to the settings to reload simfiles (I have an ssd, sorry oats)
- Shame (art by [pixloen](https://twitter.com/pixloen)) ((anim delayed by a small bit, to be fixed))
- Replaced some textures (Arrows, Edit USB thingy)
- Gradient Colors (only in purple color, wrong hue too, check second screenshot)
- Replaced few audios/sounds
- rest of the "new" stuff is probably forgotten I haven't worked on this in a long time hence it's inaccurate
- sexy af system message bar

## To be added, probably
- More color gradients
- Misc additions for mods (?)?
- Removing some stuff (e.g. "counts as 2 rounds")
- METRICS WHEEL
- Show song credit if possible
- rainbowify
- just more texture changes
- **LITERALLY USING THE NEWEST VERSION I'M LIKE 900 COMMITS BEHIND**
- cat borgar next to shame synced to the steps instead of just the song's bpm

## SCreenshot (dithered cuz compression)
