# SIMPLY LOVE (Oat's Fork)

![thumbnail](BGAnimations/ScreenLove underlay/SimplyLove doubleres.png)

A fork of NotITG's Simply Love with more features, different graphics, theming and aesethetics. This repo mainly serves as a way to sync changes with the NotITG Simply Love fork.

## Features

Do note this list is slightly inaccurate as I've only done this when pushing this repo

- **!!** I removed some Japanese/Korean/Chinese fonts that are rarely used for faster load times, but this might be what would be considered a Bad Idea
- Changes to scatterplots to show sync-relevant info
- Results screen now shows PB scoring and funnies on fail
- Hide EVENT MODE (god bless)
- Some extra animations, just for fun
- Transparency, slight graphic changes for minor things like headers/footers and fresh theming
- New fonts!
- Samario's basic chart extended stats view
- Groove Nights-like playtime
- QUICK quick play (instant song wheel)
- 57:8 aspect ratio support (oat what)
- *Just, in general, tons of weird meme additions and annoyances*
